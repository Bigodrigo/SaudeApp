## ðŸ’» Project

(*This project is associated with the website. We highly suggest reading them concurrently to gain a comprehensive understanding.*)

The concept of the app is simple: replace physical cards, access user data, and send personalized notifications (push messages)!

It utilizes NFC (Near Field Communication) for proximity functions, API to obtain data, and rendering of a user interface in React with JavaScript. To bring the visual element to fruition, the design was perfected via prototyping. To test the application, users may download an [APK](/Apk%20Donwload/application-44d64c95-78a4-44c1-aa84-0980dac01c93.apk).

Please be advised that should you wish to clone this project, some of the files must be changed, while others have been removed to ensure safety of the data.

## Suggested Enhancements:
- [ ] Introduce the ability to respond to messages without requiring the application to be open;
- [ ] Expand the functionality by incorporating FB Storage in order to enable the sending of images and documents;
- [ ] Ensure that the user is reminded to fill out all fields when changing data for the first time;
- [ ] Enhance the codebase through the replacement of certain files or screens with components in order to facilitate factorization:
    - fileUpload;
    - JanelaPerfil;
    - OpenCamera;
    - GetFetureView;
    - Virtualized;
    - ic_launcher_round.
